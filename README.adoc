Sample application for JavaEE Pipeline as code using Jenkins, Sonar and Docker presentation. Slides http://rmpestano.github.io/talks/slides/javaee-pipeline/index-en.html#/[available here^].

image:go-to-prod.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/go-to-prod.png]

The pipeline code https://github.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/blob/master/Jenkinsfile[can be found here^].

[TIP]
====
For pipeline DSL syntax highlight I recomment https://www.sublimetext.com/3[sublime text^] and this package: https://github.com/bjarneo/jenkinsfile-syntax. 

To use it just clone the above git repository into `.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/` and restart sublime.

OR use https://gist.github.com/arehmandev/736daba40a3e1ef1fbe939c6674d7da8[IntelliJ with GDSL^].
====

== Running the application

IMPORTANT: You need `Docker`, `Maven` and `Java` installed on your machine.

All commands below must be executed in project root folder.

. Create a (filesystem) database using Flyway:
+
----
mvn flyway:migrate -P migrations -D db.path=~/db
----
+
After that, a file named `cars.h2.db` will be created on your user `home/db` folder.
+
NOTE: your user must have write permissions in `~/db` directory.
+
TIP: If you are on a non unix OS like Windows you must change `db.path` to an existing directory e.g: db.path=C:/db

. Create application binary with:
+
----
mvn clean package
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you have changed *db.path* in migrations command you must build the application with the same param:

----
mvn clean package -D db.path=C:/db
----

====
. Now create a docker image using:
+
----
docker build -t tdc-pipeline .
----

. And finally run the application:
+
----
docker run -it --name tdc-pipeline -p 8080:8080 -v ~/db:/opt/jboss/db tdc-pipeline
----
+
NOTE: `-v ~/db:/opt/jboss/db` maps our host filesystem database (the one we created with Flyway) to docker container home dir so we can exit the container without losing data.
+
NOTE: `/opt/jboss/` is the home dir (`~/`) in wildfly docker container.
+
. Access the application at http://localhost:8080/tdc-pipeline

== Running tests

=== Integration tests

Tests in this application use Arquillian, http://arquillian.org/guides/getting_started_rinse_and_repeat/[see this guide^] if you never heard about it.

. Initialize database
+
----
 mvn flyway:clean flyway:migrate -Pmigrations -Ddb.name=cars-test
----
. Run the tests
+
----
mvn clean test -Pit-tests
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you want to run the test using an already running server activate `wildfly-remote` profile:

----
mvn clean test -Pit-tests -Pwildfly-remote
----
====

TIP: For `it tests` the database migration can be run only once to create tables. DataSets are prepared by http://arquillian.org/arquillian-extension-persistence/[Arquillian Persistence^].

=== Functional tests

. Initialize database
+
----
 mvn flyway:clean flyway:migrate -Pmigrations -Ddb.name=cars-ft-test
----
. Run the tests
+
----
mvn clean test -Pft-tests
----

TIP: For `ft tests` the database migration is required to be run every time the tests are run because Arquillian Persistence https://issues.jboss.org/browse/ARQ-1077[is not enabled in functional tests^].

=== Performance tests

Perf tests use https://gatling.io[Gatling tool^].

. Initialize database
+
----
 mvn flyway:clean flyway:migrate -Pmigrations -Ddb.name=cars
----
. <<Running the application,Deploy the application>>

. Run the tests
+
----
mvn clean gatling:execute -Pperf
----
+
[TIP]
====
By default perf tests run against `http://localhost:8080/tdc-pipeline/` but you can change it by passing `APP_CONTEXT` system property:

----
mvn clean gatling:execute -Pperf -DAPP_CONTEXT=http://localhost:8181/tdc-pipeline/
----
====

== Running the pipeline

This application comes with a https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Jenkins declarative pipeline^]. Below are the steps to run the pipeline locally.

WARNING: At least 8GB of RAM is needed on the host machine, 16GB is recommended. 


=== Jenkins

First thing that is needed is a Jenkins instance, http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[download Jenkins here^] and start it on port `8080` using:

----
java -jar jenkins.war
----

[NOTE]
====
It was tested with `Jenkins 2.73.2` with following plugins installed:

* Pipeline model api (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/pipeline-model-api/1.2.2/pipeline-model-api.hpi[v1.2.2 or greater^]) [Already comes with Jenkins, you may have to upgrade]
* Pipeline model definition (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/pipeline-model-definition/1.2.2/pipeline-model-definition.hpi[v1.2.2 or greater^]) [Already comes with Jenkins, you may have to upgrade]
* Last Changes (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/last-changes/1.0.11/last-changes.hpi[v1.0.11 or greater^])
* Cucumber living documentation (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/cucumber-living-documentation/1.0.12/cucumber-living-documentation.hpi[v1.0.12 or greater^])
* Gatling (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/gatling/1.2.2/gatling.hpi[v1.2.2 or greater^])
* Slack (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/slack/2.3/slack.hpi[v2.3 or greater^])
* Sonar (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/sonar/2.6.1/sonar.hpi[v2.6.1 or greater^])
* Quality gates (http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/quality-gates/2.5/quality-gates.hpi[v2.5 or greater^])

====


=== Shared library

This pipeline have an https://github.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/blob/master/vars/notify.groovy[example of shared library^]. Configure `https://github.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline` as a shared lib on `Jenkins > Configure system > Global Pipeline Libraries` like in image below:

NOTE: The name must be `notify`, it's the name of the function we invoke in https://github.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/blob/a56134d792ff9686333820f24b1aa9e4e0a4d05e/Jenkinsfile#L156[pipeline here^].

image:shared-lib.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/shared-lib.png]

More details on pipeline shared libs, https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[look here^].


=== Docker

This pipeline depends on Docker, install it according to your operating system https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation[as described here].

TIP: look for Docker CE (community edition).

TIP: To run docker without `sudo` https://askubuntu.com/questions/477551/how-can-i-use-docker-without-sudo[look here^].

=== Sonar

The pipeline depends on https://www.sonarqube.org/[Sonar^], you need to have a Sonar instance running on `http://localhost:9000`.

An easy way to start Sonar locally is just running it's docker container:

----
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 -p 9092:9092 sonarqube:6.6
----

Configure Sonar on Jenkins (http://localhost:8080/configure):

image:sonar.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/sonar.png]

=== Quality Gates

Quality gates can `fail` a pipeline if it doesn't reach the Sonar quality gates conditions, for more details https://blog.sonarsource.com/breaking-the-sonarqube-analysis-with-jenkins-pipelines/[see this post^].

Following is *Jenkins configuration* for quality gates:

image:jenkins-quality-gates.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/jenkins-quality-gates.png]


=== Configure slack

This pipeline is integrated with https://slack.com/[slack^]. You'll need to configure your Jenkins instance to work with the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Slack+Plugin[Slack plugin^].

In http://localhost:8080/configure[Jenkins configuration^] search for `Global Slack Notifier Settings` and set `Integration Token` with *SyQ9NWKGoEorB1g9h2h5xUuy* and `Base URL` with value *https://tdc-java.slack.com/services/hooks/jenkins-ci/*.
 
The configuration above will configure jenkins to send messages to the following slack channel: https://tdc-java.slack.com/messages/C7L0N9V0B

NOTE: Use https://join.slack.com/t/tdc-java/shared_invite/enQtMjYxNDk1NDcwNzg5LWYyODdjMDQxZDgyMzNkMmUyYmQ2NzA2NWQ3YjI1NjBiYjk2YzYxNzUyYTRhMDg2MDI2N2Q3ZDVlYjRhM2U0NzE[this invitation link^] to join the channel above.

For more details on how to integrate your own slack channel and Jenkins see https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/226460047-How-do-I-configure-Slack-Plugin-[this simple (5 steps) tutorial^].


=== Create the pipeline job

. Create a http://localhost:8080/view/all/newJob[new job^];
. Chose `pipeline` and give *tdc-pipeline* as name;
. On job config check `Do not allow concurrent builds` option on *General* section;
. On *Build Triggers* section Check `pool scm` and use `* * * * *` as value;
. Finally on *Pipeline* section select option `Pipeline script from scm`, chose `GIT` and use this url: http://github.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline;

After saving job configuration the pipeline should run on next minutes.

NOTE: There is an (manual) approval step before "going to production".

=== Jenkins on docker

There is also a https://github.com/rmpestano/docker-jenkins[jenkins docker container^] with above plugins installed, here is how to run it:

----
docker run -it --name jenkins -p 8080:8080 -v "$HOME/.m2":/root/.m2 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker --net="host" -v ~/.jenkins:/var/jenkins_home rmpestano/jenkins
----

IMPORTANT: <<Docker>>, <<Sonar>>, <<Quality Gates>> and <<Configure slack, Slack>> setup described above is still needed.

[WARNING]
====
When running the pipeline on docker *`ft-tests` stage will fail* because it needs chrome on docker, to make it pass you need to run ft-tests with `phantomjs`:

----
mvn test -Pft-tests -Darquillian.port-offset=120 -Darquillian.port=10110 -Darquillian.browser=phantomjs
----

====

=== After pipeline execution

The pipeline will generate a lot of evidences about the quality of the build:

. Sonar analysis along with code coverage can be viewed on http://localhost:9000/dashboard/index/com.github.rmpestano:tdc-pipeline
+
image::sonar-report.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/sonar-report.png]
. Each build VCS diff can be browsed on http://localhost:8080/job/tdc-pipeline/last-changes
+
image:vcs-diff.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/vcs-diff.png]
. Cucumber living documentation at http://localhost:8080/job/tdc-pipeline/cucumber-living-documentation
+
image:living-docs.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/living-docs.png]
. Performance tests report http://localhost:8080/job/tdc-pipeline/gatling
+
image:perf-reports.png[link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmpestano/tdc-pipeline/master/img/perf-reports.png]

[NOTE]
====
`Last changes`, `Living docs` and `Gatling reports` will be available at *job level* (http://localhost:8080/job/tdc-pipeline) if at least one pipeline succeeds. For failed pipelines you need to access *build level*, e.g: http://localhost:8080/job/tdc-pipeline/17/last-changes/ (where `17` is the build number).

image:pipeline-reports.png[]

====

Two docker containers will be started during the pipeline, one representing the application deployment on `QA` environment and another which is `production`:

image:containers.png[]

For *QA* the app should be available at http://localhost:8282/tdc-pipeline. In `Prod` env the application is available on port http://localhost:8181/tdc-pipeline.
